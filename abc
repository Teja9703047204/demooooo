1. Definition Difference
Variance measures how far the data values are from the mean, but it squares the differences, making it harder to interpret.
Standard Deviation is just the square root of variance, so it brings the measurement back to the original units of the data.

So, standard deviation is just the square root of variance.

3. Interpretation Difference
Variance is in squared units of the original data, which is difficult to interpret.
Example: If the data is in meters, variance is in square meters (m²).
Standard deviation is in the same units as the original data, making it easier to understand.
Example: If the data is in meters, standard deviation is also in meters (m).
4. Example to Understand Better
Imagine we have the following test scores:
Scores: 60, 70, 80, 90, 100

Mean (Average) = 80
Variance (VAR) = 200
Standard Deviation (STDEV) = √200 = 14.14
If we say:

Variance is 200, it means the scores deviate from the mean by 200 square units, which is not intuitive.
Standard Deviation is 14.14, which means, on average, scores deviate by 14.14 points from the mean, making more sense.
5. How Tableau Uses Them?
Variance in Tableau:
VAR([YourField]) → Sample Variance
VARP([YourField]) → Population Variance
Standard Deviation in Tableau:
STDEV([YourField]) → Sample Standard Deviation
STDEVP([YourField]) → Population Standard Deviation
